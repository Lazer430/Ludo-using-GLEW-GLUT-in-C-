This is the readme for the Linux v1.0 of the game. 
As for now the game is missing a winner screen and there is a bug in shifing corners.

Steps to configure the project in Visual Studio:
1. Clone the repository as C++ project
2. Install required libraries glut and glew (suggested to watch youtube video for instructions) 
3. Build and Run

On launch of the game it will ask to display leaderboard enter Y for yes or N for no.
Then enter number of players 1 to 4.
Then enter the names of the players one by one.
Once this is done the ludo board will appear.
Press space repeatedly till turn word appears.

Colour of turn determines turn of player 1 to 4.
Press space to roll dice and then press key 1,2,3 or 4 on keyboard to move correspoding piece.
Enjoy :)
